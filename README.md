# Angular Demo - HotelInventoryApp

This is a simple app that's powered by Angular. I am building this as a learning experience in my web development journey. My aim here was to gain exposure to the following angular concepts (they are all implemented in one form or another):

1. Decorators
2. Components
3. Directives
4. Pies
5. Lifecylce Hooks
6. Dependency Injection (DI)
7. Resolution Modifiers
8. DI Providers
9. HTTP and Observables
10. RxJS Operators
11. Angular Router
12. Dynamic Routing
13. ActivatedRoute
14. Template Driven Forms
15. Custom Directives
16. Advanced Conditional Routing
17. Reactive Forms
18. Global Error Handling
19. Testing

This App ended up being a testing ground for all these ideas, and is in no way deployment/presentation ready. But it serves as a good starting point for advanced Angular app development.

Below, you can find the general servicing documentation for this application.

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 16.0.2.

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via a platform of your choice. To use this command, you need to first add a package that implements end-to-end testing capabilities.

## Further help

To get more help on the Angular CLI use `ng help` or go check out the [Angular CLI Overview and Command Reference](https://angular.io/cli) page.
